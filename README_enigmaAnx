##NOTES:
#This README file is a supplement to the "Instructions Freesurfer subcortical segmentation" document provided by Moji Aghajani (m.aghajani@vumc.nl) and Nynke Groenewold (nynke.groenewold@uct.ac.za).
#Comorbidity is okay across anxiety diagnoses (subjects can be in more than one anxiety category).


###############
#### STEPS ####
###############

1. Run "recon-all" in freesurfer (steps 1-3 in "Instructions Freesurfer subcortical segmentation" were skipped).
   a. All PNC data (n=1601) was run through the recon-all freesurfer pipeline by Megan Quarmely and Lauren Beard.
   b. The directory for the freesurfer results is here: /data/joy/BBL/studies/pnc/processedData/structural/freesurfer53

2. Run the script "DataPrep.R" which will:
   a. Load the data files
   b. Merge the files
   c. Apply exclusions
   d. Transform variables	
   e. Make diagnosis factor variables (1=patient, 0=TD)
   f. Subset to only TD and those with an anxiety diagnosis (anxiety=690, TD=420, total=1110)
   g. Describe the sample in terms of comorbidities, med use, mean age, etc.
   h. Save the subject level data file and a .csv of the bblids/scanids of the final 1110 sample
   i. Subset the 1601 data to those under 18 to document samples sizes under 18 (just for the ENIGMA group's knowledge; analyses include all age ranges)
   j. Calculate means, sds, percentage of females, percentage of White, and Ns for entire 1601 sample
   k. Create and save a demographics table for the n1601 sample

3. Extract subcortical volumes
   a. Step 4 in the "Instructions Freesurfer subcortical segmentation" document was skipped because we already extracted the subcortical volume values for all subjects for previous ENIGMA projects.
   b. Instead, use the script "PullSubcortValues.R" which will:
      1. Read in and merge the subject level and volume data
      2. Extract the bblids and datexscanids for the script "MoveDirUp.sh" (step 5b)
      3. Pull the subcortical values for just the subjects we need for the ENIGMA Anxiety histograms
      4. Rename the variables to match the "enigma_plots.R" script provided by the ENIGMA working group
      5. Save the full n=1110 sample LandRvolumes.csv
      6. Subset by each group (panic, social anxiety, GAD, specific phobia, and TD) and save each LandRvolumes.csv file in a separate folder (before QA or after???)

4. Generate histogram plots (for detecting outliers)
   a. Use the script "enigma_plots.R" to generate the histograms 
      1. Copy enigma_plots.R into /data/jux/BBL/studies/enigmaAnxiety/figures/all
      2. To run the script, cd to that folder and type:
      	 R --no-save --slave < enigma_plots.R
   b. Use the script "outlier_LandRvolumes.R" to generate a log file that will tell you which subjects are outliers.
      1. Copy outlier_LandRvolumes.R into /data/jux/BBL/studies/enigmaAnxiety/figures/all
      2. Cd to that folder and type:
      	 R --no-save --slave < outlier_LandRvolumes.R > outliers.log

5. Copy the data files from /data/joy/BBL/studies/pnc/processedData/structural/freesurfer53 to /data/jux/BBL/studies/enigmaAnxiety/SUBJECTDATA/freesurfer53
   a. Use the script "CopyData.R"
      1. Once copied, count the number of directories in a folder to make sure all files copied over: ls -1 |wc -l
   b. Use the script "MoveDirUp.sh" which will: 
      1. Move the 'mri' folder one directory up from {bblid}/{date}/mri to {bblid}/mri
	 NOTE: This is done because we have to change the directory levels in order for the matlab script to create pngs for quality checking.  

6. Create pngs for the quality check
   a. Use the following procedure (otherwise, you will get errors about "crash dumps" because of too little memory)
      	  ssh -Y username
	(You can also add â€œssh -Y compute-0-0" here before opening Screen Session, if qlogin by itself does not work)
	  screen -S enigmaAnxiety
	  qlogin	
	  cd /data/jux/BBL/studies/enigmaAnxiety/SUBJECTDATA/freesurfer53
	  matlab -nodisplay
	  addpath /data/jux/BBL/studies/enigmaAnxiety/scripts/ENIGMA_QC
     ***Tips: Some helpful screen commands***
		a. Make a new screen window:
		     screen -S NameOfScreen
		b. Detach screen:
		     CNTRL+A followed by D
		c. To see your running screens:
		     screen -ls
		d. Attach screen:
		     screen -x NameOfScreen
		e. Exit screen:
		     exit
   b. Run the following script (this creates PNG images for each subject under 'freesurfer53/QC' directory):
	QC_output_directory='/data/jux/BBL/studies/enigmaAnxiety/SUBJECTDATA/freesurfer53/QC/'; 
	FS_directory='/data/jux/BBL/studies/enigmaAnxiety/SUBJECTDATA/freesurfer53';
	a=dir(char(strcat(FS_directory,'/*')));%Choose this so that it selects only %your subject folders that contain FS output
	for x = 1:size(a,1)
	[c,b,d]=fileparts(a(x,1).name); %b becomes the subject_name
	try
	func_make_subcorticalFS_ENIGMA_QC(QC_output_directory, b, [FS_directory,'/', b, '/mri/orig.mgz'], [FS_directory,'/',b, '/mri/aparc+aseg.mgz']);
	end
	display(['Done with subject: ', b,': ',num2str(x-2), ' of ', num2str(size(a,1)-2)]);
	end

7. Perform quality check on the webpage 
   a. Create Firefox webpage that contains brain images by region (Step 8)
	i. Go to directory where you stored script "make_subcortical_ENIGMA_QC_webpage.sh"
		(cd /data/jux/BBL/studies/enigmaAnxiety/scripts/make_subcortical_ENIGMA_QC_webpage.sh)
	ii. Change the permission status so that you can execute it
		(chmod 777 make_subcortical_ENIGMA_QC_webpage.sh)
	iii. execute the script; this will create html files in QC directory.
		(./make_subcortical_ENIGMA_QC_webpage.sh <path>/enigmaAnxiety/SUBJECTDATA/freesurfer53/QC/)	iv. Use following command before opening html files with firefox: 
		ssh -Y compute-0-0 (because html files are heavy and will crash without it)
	v. Open html files with a webpage viewer (firefox is used here).
		(firefox <path>/enigmaAnxiety/SUBJECTDATA/freesurfer53/QC/ENIGMA_Amyg_volume_QC.html)
   b. Open new terminal session, and download LandRvolumes.csv to your local environment(so that you can open it with MS excel and color-code outliers)
	(scp {YourID}@chead:/data/jux/BBL/studies/enigmaAnxiety/figures/all/LandRvolumes.csv /Users/{Your account name}/Desktop)

8. Exclude poor segmentations
   a. Open outlier log (/data/jux/BBL/studies/enigmaAnxiety/figures/all/outliers.log) with text editor (emac, gedit, etc).
   b. Open LandRvolumes.csv in your local environment, using MS excel.
   c. Go through outlier log, and mark outliers in LandRvolumes.csv file. I used color fill in excel.
   d. Open the html webpage (created in step 7a).	
	Use marked LandRvolumes.csv file to review outliers for each brain region. 
	You can use 'find' tool in firefox to easily navigate to the desired subject number.
	If the segmentation is poor, exclude it (change the number to 'NA').
   e. Go through all html files to finish QA. After finishing it, save the file and upload to the database, but to the different directory 
      (enigmaAnxiety/figures/AllQA/LandRvolumes.csv)
	(scp /Users/{Your account name}/Desktop/LandRvolumes.csv {YourID}@chead:<path>/enigmaAnxiety/figures/allQA)
